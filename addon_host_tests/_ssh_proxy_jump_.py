# Host-side gates for the two modules that decide WHERE an SSH connection
# goes: ``blender_addon/core/ssh_config.py`` (the ~/.ssh/config reader and
# the ProxyJump chain resolver) and ``blender_addon/core/ssh_command.py``
# (the ``ssh ...`` command the SSH Command backends are configured with).
#
# Both are pure text-to-connection-parameters, so they are exercised here
# rather than in Blender. What they hand to paramiko (the hop chain, the
# panel field, the profile) is covered by the ``bl_ssh_proxy_jump`` rig
# scenario, which needs the add-on loaded.
#
# The property that makes these worth pinning is that a wrong answer is
# silent: a spec read one way opens a working connection to the wrong
# host, or resolves a jump host as the destination, and the user sees a
# connection error that names neither.
